<h2>Meet Jasmine</h2>
<hr>
<p>Jasmine Lee started her foray into journalism by writing for a local music and culture publication 
    called Naked Underground as a staff writer and photographer in her last year of high school, which would 
    continue into the first two years of university. In the later years of her undergraduate degree, she switched 
    the path of her journalistic hobby to the path of politics and international relations by writing on a monthly 
    basis for the student-run publication, McGill International Review (MIR). Writing for MIR helped her explore her 
    interest in issues concerning human rights, and it was where she refined her abilities in critical thinking and 
    analytical prose. While she does not consider herself a specialist on any specific region or topic, she has a 
    plethora of knowledge on relevant socio-political issues in numerous countries. Since 2016, she has worked and/or 
    studied in five different countries across the globe, and has recently finished a Bachelor of Arts degree 
    (Major Political Science, Minor Communications) at McGill University. She hopes to continue expanding her horizons 
    through travel and explorational projects for a sustainable period of time before delving into her Master's studies. 
    Her ambitious pursuit to live a life she can be proud of has never faltered.</p>
